This was just a for-funsies experiment where you'd be able to type in Japanese
(provided you're using the JP font) and it would encode the data, hiding it from
view so that the general public would just see romaji while other people running
this mod would see both the original Japanese text as well as the displayed
romaji conversion.

You probably never have a reason to run this but it was fun to make.
